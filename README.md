# KartingMiniGame
First Unity Project! This was made with the Karting Micro Game pathway provided by Unity.

Changes made to the microgame: 
•	Made changes to the Title Screen to now say “Cece’s Karting Mini-Game!”.
•	Added two new speed boosts on the track.
•	Added the following post-processing effects:
o	Bloom, Tone-Mapping, Color Adjustments, Lift, Gamma, Gain: to make a more believable sunset/sunrise scene and make the colors pop.
o	Slight Depth of Field: for immersion purposes.
